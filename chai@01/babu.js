// Here conts can not be change once we put the value. if you think that next line you want to change accoundId soo it can not be possible.

let accountName = "Govind";
let age = 23;

// we can not use var because that variable is too old soo currently we using only let function and one think more variable and const both are written in small letter never use capital letter while coding.//

let accountCity = "Lucknow";

console.table([accountId, accountName, age, accountCity]);

// Be careful while coding because you do one mistake that is coma (,) and semi colan (;) soo just watch your every line before you gonna run your code.
